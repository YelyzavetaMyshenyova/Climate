    <h5 class="content3">What is climate change?</h5>
    <p class="content2">
In the past, it’s meant as the change and fluctuation of global temperatures. It’s a very natural event throughout the history of the Earth. However, in recent years, the warming period has been occurring more rapidly than in the past. Scientists believe this to be attributed to the increase in greenhouse gasses caused by human intervention. Greenhouse gases allow the Earth to be habitable and keep the lower atmosphere and surface of the planet warm by trapping the incoming solar energy and spreading it in all directions. Apart from the natural process of greenhouse gasses, humans cause more gasses to trap heat, causing global warming; Most human-made greenhouse gasses come from excess in carbon dioxide from fuel emission and deforestation, and emissions caused from the agriculture business (https://www.epa.gov/agriculture/agriculture-and-climate).

Carbon dioxide, CO2, is the largest contributor to greenhouse gasses and takes longer to dissipate in the atmosphere than other natural greenhouse gasses; it can be absorbed by natural reservoirs, like the ocean, and through photosynthesis, in the plants, can be created into oxygen. Therefore, deforestation is also a large contributor to global warming.

The beginning of the Industrial Revolution in 1750 increased the CO2 levels by 30% and methane emission by 140%, and, at this point in time, the concentration of CO2 is the highest it has been in at least 800,000 years.

In the US, we see recognition of the effects of climate change: long and ongoing droughts in Southeastern states, dying coral reefs in Hawai’i, excessive flooding in Louisiana, widespread wildfires in the West and Northwest states, strong and destructive storms in the East coast and Caribbean, and so much more. Without action, climate-related issues will continue to grow and expose everyone to large physical and mental risks.

In the Midwest, temperatures have increased at an accelerated rate and are projected to continue growing. In addition to this, the Midwest is known for heavy precipitation, but global warming will intensify storms and increase downpours, causing more flooding and weather complications; summers are projected to become drier and winters will bring about heavy downpours.

<h5 class="content3"> What are the impacts on senior citizens, and what are the long-term human impacts if nothing is done? </h5>

Climate change in the Midwest has increased the number of major heat waves, which causes an increasing number of deaths and heat-related illnesses every year: this is expected to grow over time because of the increase in air temperature. There will also be a lengthening of the pollen season, causing an increase in the effects on human health.

Heavy precipitation will bring about more insects and rodents, leading to a possible increase to the risk of exposure to diseases and viruses. In addition to this, heavier rainfall can lower the quality of drinking water.

Warmer water temperatures can cause algae to grow in the Great Lakes, decreasing the quality of water, and the prevention of water freezing over in the winter can cause increased amount of waves, erosion, flooding, and damages to animal habitats and properties.

Agriculture is also affected; longer warm temperatures can decrease corn crop yields and stress many other crops grown in the Midwest. Also, excessive heat will stress livestock and increase the likelihood of disease in meat, milk and eggs products, as well as cause a decline in the production of such products. The increase in temperature also affects fishing, since it would reduce the abundance of coldwater species and an increase in coolwater fish, changing the aquatic ecosystem greatly

Therefore, senior citizens will have to endure harsher and more dangerous winters (more snow and ice, making it harder to move around and increasing the risk of hospital visits), extreme temperatures in the summer (increase in heat strokes, use in AC which increases cost of living/electricity, etc), diminishing food choices (less dairy products, corn, soy, fish options, increase in risk of foodborne diseases), and reduced water quality (diseases from bugs/rodents).

<h5 class="content3">What can seniors do to help?</h5>

In order to stop the progress of climate change, we’d need to make substantial changes in the way that our society functions. The only way to substantially cut emission of greenhouse gasses in our country is by enacting aggressive legislation and policies. This is where the older generation can help by spreading awareness of the issue; especially among friends and family that actively vote. By convincing those around them of the importance of climate change, we can get more votes for legislation and government officials that are committed to addressing the issue. 

In the 2018 midterm elections, only “49 percent of eligible voters” came out to vote (CBS News). In past years, voter turnout has gotten as low as 36%. Essentially, this means that if all of the voters that support taking action against climate change turn out to vote for their cause, their candidate has a good chance of winning the elections. 

There are, however, other ways of making an impact. Some older citizens may simply not be interested in political activism, or they are unwilling to throw their weight behind a single policy or candidate just on the basis of one issue. In this case, we ask you to reach out to family, children, and grandkids, who will be essential in how the next few decades turn out. Convince your grandkids to be more aware of their actions, or maybe pitch the idea of a more eco-friendly vehicle to your family. A single aware grandparent can reach half a dozen family members, and contribute to a wave of change in the future.
